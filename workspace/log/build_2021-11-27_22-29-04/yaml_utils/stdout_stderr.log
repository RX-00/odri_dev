CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "yaml-cpp" with any
  of the following names:

    yaml-cppConfig.cmake
    yaml-cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "yaml-cpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "yaml-cpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "yaml-cpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

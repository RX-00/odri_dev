CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findeigen-quadprog.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "eigen-quadprog", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "eigen-quadprog"
  with any of the following names:

    eigen-quadprogConfig.cmake
    eigen-quadprog-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "eigen-quadprog" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "eigen-quadprog_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "eigen-quadprog" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
